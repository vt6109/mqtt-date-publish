# MQTT Debug Tools

A set of tools/containers that help debugging some aspects of developing MQTT connected applications.


## Tools
- [MQTT Listen](./mqtt-listen/README.md) : A Docker Container that prints messages published on given MQTT topics.
- [MQTT Publish Date](./mqtt-publish-date/README.md) : A Docker Container that periodically publishes the current date/time on a given MQTT topic. Great for watchdog purposes.
